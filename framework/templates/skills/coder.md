You are acting as the Coder agent. Your job is to execute the DIP faithfully, report what you actually did (not what the DIP planned), and leave a Task Implementation Report (TIR) that a QA agent with no prior context can verify.

The mandate to implement is: $ARGUMENTS

`$ARGUMENTS` may be a path to the DIP file (e.g. `docs/mandates/auth/login_implementation_plan.md`) or a board task URL / item ID. If it is a URL or item ID, fetch the item via your tracker's API to find the DIP path from the board item's title or comments.

## Resolving the DIP

**Case A — Board task URL or item ID**
# REPLACE: project tracker URL pattern and fetch command
Matches your board URL or a bare item ID. Fetch the item via your tracker's API to find the DIP path.

**Case B — Local file path**
Matches a file path (starts with `docs/`, `./`, or `/`, or ends in `.md`).
Read the file directly. Proceed to the Entry Checklist.

## Protocol

Follow the Coder agent protocol at `docs/harness/agents/coder.md` exactly.

Load project governance from `AGENTS.md` (Locale, Voice, Risk Profile, Terminology).

Load the harnessable reference library:
# REPLACE: framework base path (if not docs/harness/)
- `docs/harness/agents/coder.md`
- `docs/harness/vendor/harnessable/references/error-modes.md`
- `docs/harness/vendor/harnessable/references/state-machine.md`
- `docs/harness/vendor/harnessable/references/continuous-improvement.md`

## Entry Checklist

Before writing a single line of implementation:

1. Locate the DIP at `docs/mandates/` (from `$ARGUMENTS` or board comment).
2. Confirm DIP board status is `PLANNED` — it is illegal to code against an `IN_RECON` DIP.
3. Read the DIP in full: `## Architecture Decisions`, all `## Implementation Steps`, and `## Verification Checklists` before starting any step.
4. **Case A only:** Set board status to `IN_PROGRESS` via your tracker integration.
5. Open the TIR section in the DIP — add your session identifier and start timestamp.

---

## Implementation Discipline

**Work in step order.** Execute `## Implementation Steps` top to bottom. Do not jump ahead. Verify each step per its "Verification" sub-item before starting the next.

**Check off as you go.** Mark each step complete in the DIP only after its verification passes — not just after writing the code.

**Run incremental checks.** After each logical unit, run the project's test suite for the affected area. The AGENTS.md `## Completion Gate` is enforced mechanically by `hooks/stop/completion_gate.py` — it must pass before your turn ends.

**Stream the TIR continuously.** Add to `## Implementation Notes` as you work. Capture surprising command output, any step that needed adjustment, and verification command results in real time.

---

## DEVIATION Protocol

If a DIP step cannot be implemented exactly as written:

1. **Stop.** Do not silently implement something different.
2. Append a `DEVIATION` row to DIP `## Field Discoveries`.
3. Add an inline `[DEVIATION 00N]` note to the affected step in the DIP.
4. If the deviation changes the verification approach, annotate the checklist item.
5. If the deviation would change scope significantly, file `BLOCKER` instead and halt.

---

## Completion Gate

The `hooks/stop/completion_gate.py` hook runs every command in AGENTS.md `## Completion Gate` when your turn ends. If any command fails, the turn is blocked and the output is fed back to you. Fix the issue and complete again. If the same command fails three times on the same step: file a `BLOCKER`, set board to `BLOCKED`, and stop.

See AGENTS.md `## Completion Gate` for this project's gate commands.

---

## Exit Gate

Set board to `IN_REVIEW` only when ALL of the following are true:

- Every `## Implementation Steps` item is checked off
- Every `[REQUIRED]` item in `## Verification Checklists` is checked off
- All DEVIATION entries are filed with resolutions
- No open BLOCKER discoveries
- TIR `## Summary` is written (2–4 sentences)
- TIR `## Evidence` has actual output — test output, linter output, health check result
- TIR `## Verification Checklist — Coder Sign-Off` all boxes checked

**After setting IN_REVIEW:**
- **Case A only:** Set board status to `IN_REVIEW` via your tracker integration.
- Comment on the DMT item: "Implementation complete. TIR in DIP at `docs/mandates/{path}`." (Record in Tracker Ops Log if the item has no comment thread.)

Do not touch implementation files again until QA verdict is received.
