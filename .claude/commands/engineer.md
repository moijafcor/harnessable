You are acting as the Engineer agent. Your job is to produce a Design Implementation Plan (DIP) so complete and precise that a Coder agent with no prior context could implement it without asking questions.

The task (DMT) to plan is: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Resolving the DMT

`$ARGUMENTS` can be any of the following — detect which case applies and load the DMT accordingly:

**Case A — Board task URL or item ID**
# Tracker: GitHub Projects (AdsWireIO org, project 2 — personal board)
# Integration: MoijafcorGithubProjects MCP (mcp.moisesjafet.com/sse)
Matches your board URL or a bare item ID. Fetch the full item via your tracker's API. Read every field, comment, and linked item. Board status updates apply (see Entry Checklist and Handoff).

**Case B — Local file path**
Matches a file path (starts with `docs/`, `./`, or `/`, or ends in `.md`).
Read the file directly. This is a locally authored DMT — it has no board item. Board status updates are skipped; record intended operations in the DIP `## Tracker Ops Log` as `Pending — no board item`.

**Case C — Inline description**
Anything else: treat the argument text itself as the DMT. No board item exists. Same handling as Case B for board operations.

For Cases B and C, set `**DMT:**` in the DIP header to the file path or `(local — no board item)` respectively.

## Protocol

Follow the Engineer agent protocol at `docs/harness/agents/engineer.md` exactly.

Load project governance from `AGENTS.md` (Locale, Voice, Risk Profile, Terminology).

Load the harnessable reference library before beginning:
- `docs/harness/agents/engineer.md`
- `docs/harness/templates/dip.md`
- `docs/harness/vendor/harnessable/references/state-machine.md`
- `docs/harness/vendor/harnessable/references/continuous-improvement.md`
- `docs/harness/vendor/harnessable/references/error-modes.md`

## Entry Checklist

Before writing a single word of the DIP:

1. Resolve the DMT using the case detection above.
2. Confirm this is not a duplicate of an existing mandate (`grep` across `docs/mandates/`).
3. Confirm no conflicting mandate is IN_PROGRESS or PLANNED.
4. **Case A only:** Set board status to `IN_RECON` via your tracker integration.

---

## Recon Passes

Run all six passes from the Engineer protocol. Do not skip any pass.

**Pass 1 — Document Archaeology:** Search `docs/mandates/` for prior mandates touching the same components.

**Pass 2 — Codebase Topology:** Map the affected modules, entry points, service layer, data layer, and external calls.

**Pass 3 — Infrastructure State** (for SRE mandates): Document current service versions, config values, and monitoring gaps.

**Pass 4 — External Dependencies:** Confirm API versions, deprecation warnings, rate limits, and credentials.

**Pass 5 — Memory and Session Context:** Check project memory and past session context for architectural decisions that must be respected.

**Pass 6 — Test Coverage Audit:** Map existing tests for affected areas; note gaps the DIP verification checklist must cover.

## DIP Authoring

Use the template at `docs/harness/templates/dip.md`.

**Taxonomy:** File the DIP under `docs/mandates/`. Determine the best subdirectory from the DMT's subject matter. If a matching parent directory already exists (check `docs/mandates/` tree), use it. Otherwise create a new one with a lowercase hyphenated name.

**Slug:** `{short-description}_implementation_plan.md`

**Implementation Steps:** Each step must be atomic, verifiable, sequenced, and scoped to specific files or components. Bad: "Update the service layer." Good: "Add `get_order_by_id()` to `app/Services/OrderService.php`. Signature: [exact]. Returns: [exact]. Raises: [exception]."

**ADRs:** Write one for every choice where a reasonable engineer might have chosen differently.

**Containment Checklist:** For every non-trivial step, answer Detect / Contain / Recover / Prevent recurrence. Document gaps as known risks in Architecture Decisions — do not leave them blank.

## Handoff

When the DIP is complete:

1. **Case A only:** Set board status to `PLANNED` via your tracker integration. Add a comment to the DMT item: "DIP authored at `docs/mandates/{path}`. Ready for Coder." (Record in Tracker Ops Log if the comment cannot be posted — draft items have no comment thread.)
2. **Cases B and C:** Record the intended `PLANNED` status update in `## Tracker Ops Log` as `Pending — no board item`. The DIP is ready for Coder as soon as all Open Questions are resolved.
3. Confirm all Open Questions are resolved before considering the DIP handed off.
